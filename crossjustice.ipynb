Oral translations or summaries are allowed if they do not compromise fairness. The state must cover the costs of these translations.\\n- **Prolog Facts Referenced**:\\n  1. `proceeding_language(mario, dutch)` - The proceedings are conducted in Dutch.\\n  2. `not(person_understands(mario, dutch))` - Mario does not understand Dutch.\\n  3. `essential_document(art3_3, mario, documents)` - The documents in question are essential for Mario's defense.\\n  4. `auxiliary_right(art4, art3_1, mario, cost, state)` - The state covers the costs of translation.\\n  5. `not(proceeding_event(mario, prejudice_fairness))` - Oral translations are acceptable as fairness is not prejudiced.\\n\\n#### **Legal Source 2: Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure (Article 32a(1))**\\n- **Summary**: Mario, as a suspect who does not understand Dutch, can request translations of essential documents in a language he understands. The request must be written, justified, and specify the documents. The state covers the costs of these translations.\\n- **Prolog Facts Referenced**:\\n  1. `person_status(mario, suspect)` - Mario is a suspect.\\n  2. `not(person_understands(mario, dutch))` - Mario does not understand Dutch.\\n  3. `person_request_submitted(mario, essential_document)` - Mario submitted a written request for translation of essential documents.\\n  4. `has_right(right_to_translation, nl, art32a_1, mario, essentialDocument)` - Mario has the right to translation under Article 32a(1).\\n  5. `auxiliary_right(art1_4, art32a_1, mario, cost, state)` - The state covers the costs of translation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 2: Comparison of Prolog Facts\\n\\n#### **Common Prolog Facts**:\\n1. `not(person_understands(mario, dutch))` - Mario does not understand Dutch.\\n2. `auxiliary_right(..., mario, cost, state)` - The state covers the costs of translation.\\n3. Both sources recognize Mario's right to translation of essential documents.\\n\\n#### **Differences in Prolog Facts**:\\n1. **Directive 2010/64**:\\n   - `proceeding_language(mario, dutch)` - Specifies the language of the proceedings.\\n   - `essential_document(art3_3, mario, documents)` - Focuses on the classification of documents as essential.\\n   - `not(proceeding_event(mario, prejudice_fairness))` - Allows oral translations if fairness is not compromised.\\n\\n2. **Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure**:\\n   - `person_status(mario, suspect)` - Explicitly identifies Mario as a suspect.\\n   - `person_request_submitted(mario, essential_document)` - Requires Mario to submit a written request for translation.\\n   - `has_right(right_to_translation, nl, art32a_1, mario, essentialDocument)` - Links Mario's right to Article 32a(1).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 3: Analysis of Consequences\\n\\n1. **Directive 2010/64**:\\n   - Mario's right to translation is automatic if the documents are essential and he does not understand Dutch.\\n   - Oral translations are permissible, provided fairness is not compromised. This flexibility could expedite proceedings but may risk fairness if not properly monitored.\\n\\n2. **Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure**:\\n   - Mario must actively request translations in writing, which places a procedural burden on him.\\n   - The focus on a written request ensures clarity and specificity but may delay the process if Mario is unaware of this requirement or unable to comply promptly.\\n\\n**Key Consequences**:\\n- The Directive provides broader and more automatic protections, ensuring fairness without requiring Mario to take additional steps.\\n- The Dutch Code introduces procedural requirements that could hinder Mario's access to translations if he fails to meet them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Step 4: Which Legal Source Favours the Individual?\\n\\n**Directive 2010/64** is more favorable to Mario because:\\n- It automatically grants the right to translation of essential documents without requiring a written request.\\n- It allows oral translations as a flexible option, provided fairness is not compromised.\\n- It places fewer procedural burdens on Mario, ensuring his defense rights are protected more effectively.\\n\\nIn contrast, the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure imposes additional procedural requirements (e.g., a written request), which could delay or complicate Mario's access to translations.\", 'why': {'input': \"\\n    Legal Source:\\n\\n    Sure!

Based on the previous context and instructions, here’s the structured response:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Summary:\\nThe legal norm guarantees that anyone accused or suspected of a crime, who does not understand the language of the legal proceedings, is entitled to receive translations of important documents. This ensures they can properly defend themselves and that the trial is fair. Additionally, oral translations are allowed in some cases, but only if fairness is not compromised.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What Rights Do You Have:\\n1. **The Right to Translation of Essential Documents**:\\n   - Ensures that Mario, who does not understand Dutch, receives translations of documents critical to his defense (Article 3).\\n2. **The Right to Auxiliary Assistance for Costs**:\\n   - Guarantees that Mario is not burdened with the costs of translation or interpretation, as these are covered by the state (Article 4).\\n3. **The Right to Oral Translation** (under specific conditions):\\n   - States that oral translations or summaries can be provided instead of written translations if it does not harm the fairness of the proceedings (Article 3.7).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why Do You Have Them:\\n1. **Right to Translation of Essential Documents**:\\n   - This is derived from **Article 3** of Directive 2010/64. According to the Prolog, Mario has the right to translation because:\\n     - The proceeding language for Mario is Dutch (`proceeding_language(mario, dutch)`), but Mario does not understand Dutch (`not(person_understands(mario, dutch))`).\\n     - The documents in question are classified as **essential documents** (`essential_document(art3_3, mario, documents)`).\\n     - The translation is necessary to ensure Mario's ability to exercise his defense rights and the fairness of the proceedings, as required by Article 3.\\n\\n2. **Right to Auxiliary Assistance for Costs**:\\n   - Based on **Article 4**, the state must bear the costs of translations. From the Prolog, this auxiliary right is directly linked to Mario having the primary right to translation of essential documents (`auxiliary_right(art4, art3_1, mario, cost, state)`).\\n\\n3. **Right to Oral Translation**:\\n   - As per **Article 3.7**, oral translation or summaries are acceptable as long as fairness is not compromised. The Prolog mentions that there is no prejudice to fairness in Mario’s proceedings (`not(proceeding_event(mario, prejudice_fairness))`), and hence, oral translation is a valid option.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nLet me know if you’d like further clarification!\\n\\n    Legal Source:\\n\\n    Certainly! Based on the provided context, here's a structured response to the task:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Summary:\\nAccording to Article 32a(1) of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure, if someone is a suspect and does not fully understand Dutch, they can ask for important legal documents in their case to be translated into a language they understand. This request must be written, well-explained, and specify which documents need translation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What Rights do You Have:\\n1. **Right to Translation**: Mario has the right to receive translations of essential legal documents (Article 32a(1), Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure).\\n2. **Right to State-Covered Costs**: The cost of these translations will be covered by the state (Article 1(4), Criminal Cases Fees Act).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why do You Have Them:\\n1. **Right to Translation**:\\n   - Mario is identified as a **suspect** (`person_status(mario, suspect)` [FACT]).\\n   - Mario does not sufficiently understand the Dutch language, as implied in the case context.\\n   - Mario submitted a written request for translation of an **essential document** (`person_request_submitted(mario, essential_document)` [FACT]).\\n   - Article 32a(1) states that a suspect who does not understand Dutch can request translations of necessary legal documents, provided the request is written and justified. This aligns with the Prolog fact `has_right(right_to_translation, nl, art32a_1, mario, essentialDocument)`.\\n\\n2. **Right to State-Covered Costs**:\\n   - Article 1(4) of the Criminal Cases Fees Act states that the cost of certain legal rights, such as translations, will be borne by the state. This is referenced in the auxiliary Prolog rule: `auxiliary_right(art1_4, art32a_1, mario, cost, state)`.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet me know if further clarification is needed!\\n\\n    Context:\\n\\n    Article 3\\n\\nRight to translation of essential documents\\n\\n1.

Based on the previous context and instructions, here’s the structured response:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Summary:\\nThe legal norm guarantees that anyone accused or suspected of a crime, who does not understand the language of the legal proceedings, is entitled to receive translations of important documents. This ensures they can properly defend themselves and that the trial is fair. Additionally, oral translations are allowed in some cases, but only if fairness is not compromised.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What Rights Do You Have:\\n1. **The Right to Translation of Essential Documents**:\\n   - Ensures that Mario, who does not understand Dutch, receives translations of documents critical to his defense (Article 3).\\n2. **The Right to Auxiliary Assistance for Costs**:\\n   - Guarantees that Mario is not burdened with the costs of translation or interpretation, as these are covered by the state (Article 4).\\n3. **The Right to Oral Translation** (under specific conditions):\\n   - States that oral translations or summaries can be provided instead of written translations if it does not harm the fairness of the proceedings (Article 3.7).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Why Do You Have Them:\\n1. **Right to Translation of Essential Documents**:\\n   - This is derived from **Article 3** of Directive 2010/64. According to the Prolog, Mario has the right to translation because:\\n     - The proceeding language for Mario is Dutch (`proceeding_language(mario, dutch)`), but Mario does not understand Dutch (`not(person_understands(mario, dutch))`).\\n     - The documents in question are classified as **essential documents** (`essential_document(art3_3, mario, documents)`).\\n     - The translation is necessary to ensure Mario's ability to exercise his defense rights and the fairness of the proceedings, as required by Article 3.\\n\\n2. **Right to Auxiliary Assistance for Costs**:\\n   - Based on **Article 4**, the state must bear the costs of translations. From the Prolog, this auxiliary right is directly linked to Mario having the primary right to translation of essential documents (`auxiliary_right(art4, art3_1, mario, cost, state)`).\\n\\n3. **Right to Oral Translation**:\\n   - As per **Article 3.7**, oral translation or summaries are acceptable as long as fairness is not compromised. The Prolog mentions that there is no prejudice to fairness in Mario’s proceedings (`not(proceeding_event(mario, prejudice_fairness))`), and hence, oral translation is a valid option.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nLet me know if you’d like further clarification!\\n\\n    Legal Source:\\n\\n    Certainly!

      "- It allows oral translations as a flexible option, provided fairness is not compromised.\n",
      "- It places fewer procedural burdens on Mario, ensuring his defense rights are protected more effectively.\n",
