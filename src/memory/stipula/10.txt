15 @Waiting_order Buyer : place_order ()[w] {
16 w/( price×formula ) → order
17 order → Seller
18 w ⊸ wallet
19 } => @Order

Then the contract transits in the state @Waiting_order. In
this state, the Buyer purchases gas by means of the function place_order. This
function takes w representing the currency sent for the purchase (the square
brackets identify the parameters that are assets). The corresponding amount of
gas, e.g. w/(price×formula), is stored into order (line 16) and communicated
to the Seller (line 17); then w is escrowed by the contract and stored in wallet
(line 18). At this point, the contract transits to the @Order state, enabling the
Seller to call the send_gas function.
