It may represent an internal tracking mechanism within the smart contract to record the payment.  \\n  **Contract Text:** *No specific correspondence.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n- **Function Aspect:** The contract transitions to state `@Q5` after the function execution.  \\n  **Explanation:** This likely represents the progression of the contract lifecycle after the first repayment is made, moving it to the next phase. However, the natural language contract does not explicitly describe such a state transition.  \\n  **Contract Text:** *No specific correspondence.*\\n\\n---\\n\\n- **Contract:** Article Title: \"Events of Default\"  \\n  **Function:** `fn()` - State of Invocation: `@Q4`  \\n  **Code:**  \\n  ```stipula\\n  @Q4 Lender: fn()[] (field3 > 0){\\n      \"notice\" -> Borrower;\\n      now + 48 >> @Q4 {\"default\" -> Borrower} => @Qd\\n  } => @Q4\\n  ```  \\n\\n  **Function Aspect:** The precondition `(field3 > 0)` must be satisfied for the function to be invoked.  \\n  **Explanation:** This may represent a condition where the Borrower has an outstanding payment due (field3 > 0). The natural language contract specifies that the Borrower must make timely payments, and failure to do so constitutes an event of default.  \\n  **Contract Text:** \"Borrower shall fail to make timely payment of any amount due to Lender hereunder.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n- **Function Aspect:** The operation `\"notice\" -> Borrower` sends a notice to the Borrower.  \\n  **Explanation:** This corresponds to the requirement in the contract that the Lender must give notice to the Borrower of an event of default and allow a two-day cure period.  \\n  **Contract Text:** \"Provided they shall remain uncured within a period of two days after notice is given to Borrower by Lender of their occurrence.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n- **Function Aspect:** The operation `now + 48 >> @Q4 {\"default\" -> Borrower} => @Qd` sets a 48-hour timer, after which the contract transitions to state `@Qd` if the default is not remedied.  \\n  **Explanation:** This represents the two-day cure period specified in the contract, after which the Borrower is considered in default if the issue remains unresolved.  \\n  **Contract Text:** \"Provided they shall remain uncured within a period of two days after notice is given to Borrower by Lender of their occurrence.\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n- **Function Aspect:** The contract remains in state `@Q4` if the default is cured within the 48-hour period.  \\n  **Explanation:** This corresponds to the Borrower\\'s ability to remedy the default and avoid further consequences, as outlined in the contract.  \\n  **Contract Text:** \"A default will be cured by the Borrower (i) remedying the potential event of default and (ii) giving effective notice of such remedy to the Lender.\"\\n\\n', 'why': {'input': 'Contract:\\n\\n\\n\\nThis loan agreement dated June 1, 2022, by and between Lender Bank Co.
