Lines 13-14 express an event: a timer is triggered and, if the limit expires (“t_start”) with the contract’s state still being “@Proposal”, then the token is sent back to the lender and the contract is terminated (@End state). After the three operations are executed (transfer of [t], (n) and the timeout triggered) the contract’s state is switched to “@Proposal”.
