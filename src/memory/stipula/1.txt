Lines 1 to 3: the smart contract indicates what are the fields and the assets. As mentioned already, we have two assets, a token and a balance. The fields outline the license cost, the deadline for the acceptance of the license contract proposal (“t_start”) and the evaluation period duration (“t_limit”).
