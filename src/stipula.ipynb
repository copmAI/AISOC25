      "Events are sequences of timed continuations that can be included in the body of a function. They are employed to schedule the execution of future operations if specific preconditions are met. Usually, contract states are used as preconditions. Events consist of a timeout, which is initiated when the function is called, a precondition (state) and the consequential operation that may be triggered (a statement).

This function involves two elements: the token that represents the locker “[t]” and its identification number “(n)”.  The different type of brackets used indicates the different kind of value they contain: square brackets contain asset values (i.e., linear resources) and round brackets simple field values (simple data). By calling this function the lender sends both elements to the smart contract’s address: “t” is sent in the contract’s asset “token” (line 11), and “n” to field “numBox” (line 12). Note that the token is transferred through the lollypop operator, meaning that it was subtracted from the previous location (lender’s address).
