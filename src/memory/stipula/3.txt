Lines 17 to 26: “activateLicense” function. The licensee decides to activate the contract by sending the amount of money agreed upon in the agreement (b), to the contract’s asset “balance” in escrow (line 19). The contract then sends him back a use code generated by the token that would grant the temporary access to the software (line 21). Note that, in line 20, a 10 % of the total sum escrowed is sent from the asset “balance” to the Authority as a fee.
