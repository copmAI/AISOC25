Lines 19 to 23: the event in line 19-22 is used to automatically enforce the obligation of terminating the rent of the box by a certain deadline (t_limit).
If at the expiry of “t_limit” the contract is still in the “@Using” state (line 19),  it will be terminated autmatically by sending  a message to the Borrower and transitioning to the state @End (line 22). If the contract remains in the @Using state it means that the function to terminate the rent "returnBox " hasn't been called yet by the borrower.
The contract then moves to state “@Using” (line 23) allowing the borrower to call returnBox.
