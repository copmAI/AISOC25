Article 4. This license will terminate automatically at the end
of the evaluation period, if the licensee does not buy the
product.

17 @Proposal Licensee : activateLicence [b]
18 (b == cost ){
19 b ⊸ balance
20 balance *0 ,1 ⊸ balance , Authority
21 uses (token , Licensee ) -> Licensee
22 now + t_limit >> @Trial {
23 balance ⊸ Licensee
24 token ⊸ Licensor
25 } ==> @End
26 } ==> @Trial
27
28 @Trial Licensee : buy {
29 balance ⊸ Licensor
30 token ⊸ Licensee
31 } ==> @End

The event in lines 22-25 implements the provision of article 4. If t_limit expires and the contract is still in state @Trial (meaning that the buy function hasn't been called yet), the contract terminates transitioning in state @End.
