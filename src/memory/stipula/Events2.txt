3.2.3	Events
Events are sequences of timed continuations that can be included in the body of a function. They are employed to schedule the execution of future operations if specific preconditions are met. Usually, contract states are used as preconditions. Events consist of a timeout, which is initiated when the function is called, a precondition (state) and the consequential operation that may be triggered (a statement). According to the formula E >> @Q {S} ==> @Q’  if the timer  E expires with the contract state still being @Q, then the statement S is executed, and the contract’s state is switched to @Q’. 
Events are defined within functions and can be employed to automatically enforce obligations. The operations included in the statement can represent either the automated performance or the penalty for the non-performance which is automatically issued by the smart contract. The timeout expiry coincides with the moment where the obligation become due. For example, in the free bike rental, when the timer expires and the borrower has not returned the bike yet, an event is triggered that automatically sends back to the lender the token that allows the bike usage.
